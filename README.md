<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on specific features. It includes implementations of two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p><ol type="1"><li>Run the Jupyter Notebook containing the model implementations.</li><li>Explore and analyze the results.</li></ol></p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>Name of the dataset that was used in this project: "heart_statlog_cleveland_hungary_final.csv". It contains data related to heart disease. It combines datasets from Hungary, Cleveland, Long Beach VA, Switzerland, and Statlog. The dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. You can get it from here (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heart-disease-dataset-comprehensive)</p>
<h2>Models</h2>
<h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
<ul type="bullet"><li>Implemented using scikit-learn's LogisticRegression class.</li><li>Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting BP S, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Angina, Oldpeak, ST Slope.</li></ul>
<h4>Naive Bayes</h4>
<ul type="bullet"><li>Implemented using scikit-learn's Naive Bayes class.</li><li>Features: Cholesterol, Maximum Heart Rate.</li></ul>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Model performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix, are included in the evaluation report. Refer to the evaluation section of the Jupyter Notebook for detailed results.</p>
